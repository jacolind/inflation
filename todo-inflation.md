Hello,

Thank you for your message. The Government Consumption indicators have been updated. Please refer to the indicator 'General government final consumption expenditure' for data on government expenditures: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/Government-consumption/id/7de29794

General government final consumption expenditure (formerly general government consumption) includes all government current expenditures for purchases of goods and services (including compensation of employees). It also includes most expenditures on national defense and security, but excludes government military expenditures that are part of government capital formation.

For information regarding the official exchange rate used for countries, please refer to the indicator: 'Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average)' (  http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=PA.NUS.FCRF&country= ) and 'DEC alternative conversion factor (LCU per US$); (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.ATLS). Please note an alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. This applies to only a small number of countries, as shown in the country-level metadata
